# Unit 2: Project 2

https://frazerfarmfeedme.herokuapp.com/





## Technology used:

### Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS

### Full CRUD

### Bootstrap

## Frazier Farm Daily Feed schedule:

### Main index shows a Picture, description of the business and login.

### After Login index page shows all of the horses that are at the boarding facility. Clicking on the image redirects to the show page. New horses can be added and Daily feeding schedule can be displayed via the NAV bar.

### Show page, displays information for the selected horse. Information can be edited or the horse can be deleted via buttons in the form.

### New page, allows the addition of a horse.

### Daily feeding schedule will show the feed for the horses that have a board type of "full". Horses can be changed to full board via the Edit buttons on the show page.

## Notes/Unsolved Problems/Approach

### Original project was scrapped. Lesson learned - do not try to make MongoDB act like a relational database !!!

### Login shell in place but not functional - did not get working like class example because not suited fo the application.

#### Allow admin acces to update any horse and owner access to update their horse.

#### Restrict access to boarders only. Admin sets up initial user profile?

### Add additional info like veterinarian and farrier contact information.

### Remove quotes added every time textarea is updates.

### Feedback from other boarders: would it to like to send notifications to admin and owner when horse information is modified. Possiblly have another textarea where owner can provide temporary instrucitons - i.e. can you please give banamine today with feed.

### Drop down lists for things like typeOfBoard and gender.

### Jumbotron to be scalable.

### Use EJS partials
